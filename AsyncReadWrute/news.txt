Germany's Lufthansa Group Airlines is suing a passenger who found a 
cheap way to travel between several cities in Europe and the U.S., saying 
the customer broke its rules when he skipped part of his return flight o
n a round-trip ticket from Oslo to Seattle. Now it wants him to pay more 
than $2,000 to make up the difference.

The man used a method to book his multistop trip that's known as "hidden city"
 ticketing — where travelers find layover cities on an airliner's route that are
  cheaper than a direct flight from one city to another.

For example, someone hoping to travel from New York to Dallas might look 
for cheaper flights to Los Angeles that also stop in that city — and simply
 disembark there, rather than fly the full route to LAX.

              The man used a method to book his multistop trip that's known as "hidden city"
               ticketing — where travelers find layover cities on an airliner's route that are
                cheaper than a direct flight from one city to another.
              
              For example, someone hoping to travel from New York to Dallas might look 
              for cheaper flights to Los Angeles that also stop in that city — and simply
               disembark there, rather than fly the full route to LAX.
               Germany's Lufthansa Group Airlines is suing a passenger who found a 
               cheap way to travel between several cities in Europe and the U.S., saying 
               the customer broke its rules when he skipped part of his return flight o
               n a round-trip ticket from Oslo to Seattle. Now it wants him to pay more 
               than $2,000 to make up the difference.
